* Rationale

Breaking your code down into discrete functions allows you to re-use
code in intelligent ways, and to make your code more efficient
overall. You can use functions written by other people (by linking
them to your own programs) and avoid having to write everything from
scratch yourself.

Writing functions to perform common tasks means that you can
essentially write your own meta-language. For example *if* you have
functions already written to perform these tasks, your C program might
look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
     loadSubjects();
     excludeSubject(12);
     lowpassFilterData();
     collectMeansWithBinSize(8);
     pval = performANOVA();
     printf("my hypothesis is correct, p < %.3f\n", pval);
     return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

The idea is that once we know what sorts of operations on our data we
will wish to do, we can write a set of functions (sometimes called
subroutines), to *abstract* away the details, and provide us with a
sort of high-level meta-language that we can use to carry out the
steps we wish to.

** Abstraction

Using functions to abstract away the details also means that as long
as the function inputs and outputs are known, then the user doesn't
really need to know the details of how the function performs its
task. Another way to think about this: let's imagine you wrote a
function =lowpassFilterData()=, and it worked well. Let's say your
friend came along one day and noticed that it was taking a long time
to process your data, and he suggested you use a different algorithm
for low-pass filtering, and he gave you a file containing the code. As
long as the inputs and outputs are the same (or you could write your
own "wrapper" function to ensure this), then you can simply switch out
your function for the new one, and all functionality should be the
same. You can think of functions as "black boxes" with input and
output wires. As long as the wires are labelled the same, and there
are the same number, you can replace one box with a newer box, and
perhaps get faster (or more accurate, for example) functionality
*without changing your main program*.

* Defining a Function

A function must be defined in the following way:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
returnType functionName (arg1Type arg1Name, arg2Type arg2Name) {
   function_statement;
   function_statement;
   return returnVar;
}
#+END_SRC

This seems rather abstract, but we will see a concrete example in a
moment. On the first line, we have to begin by declaring what data
*type* the function will return once it finishes. You can define a
function that doesn't return anything by using =void=. The next item
is the name of the function, which you get to choose. Next, in round
brackets, is a list of input arguments that the function expects to
see when it is called. Each argument is declared by listing first the
*type* of the argument, followed by its name. Then in the body of the
function is code, which does whatever you want the function to
do. Finally we have to *return* a value (if the return type is
non-void).

Here is a more concrete example. Let's say we want to write a function
that writes a message to the screen, "Hello, Paul":

#+BEGIN_SRC c
void writeMessage(void) {
   printf("Hello, Paul\n");
}
#+END_SRC

Here the return type is =void= since the function doesn't return a
value, and the input argument list is also =void=, since it doesn't
expect any inputs. We can call the function in a program like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <stdio.h>

void writeMessage(void) {
   printf("Hello, Paul\n");
}

int main() {
	writeMessage();
	return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Hello, Paul
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Input Arguments

Now let's modify our function so that it accepts one input argument,
which is a string containing the name we want to say hello to. So for
example we could call the function with =writeMessage("Dave")= and it
would print to the screen ~Hello, Dave~, or we could call it with
=writeMessage("Victoria")= and it would write to the screen ~Hello,
Victoria~, etc:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>

void writeMessage(char name[]) {
   printf("Hello, %s\n", name);
}

int main() {
	writeMessage("Dave");
	writeMessage("Victoria");
	return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Hello, Dave
Hello, Victoria
#+END_EXAMPLE

For the moment don't worry about the =char[]= type, it is a character
array, and we will talk about arrays in the next section.

Let's give our function two input arguments now, just to see how this is done:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <stdio.h>

void writeMessage(char name[], int n) {
   printf("Hello, %s %d\n", name, n);
}

int main() {
	writeMessage("Dave", 123);
	writeMessage("Victoria", 444);
	return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Hello, Dave 123
Hello, Victoria 444
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Return Value

Let's consider another example, one where we want our function to
return a value. Let's write a function to compute Fibonacci numbers
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number][Wikipedia]]). Fibonacci numbers are defined as:

\begin{equation}
F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
\end{equation}

where $F_{0}=0$ and $F_{1}=1$.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <stdio.h>

int Fibonacci(int n) {
	if (n==0) return 0;
	else if (n==1) return 1;
	else return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2);
}

int main() {
	int n = 10;
	int Fn = Fibonacci(n);
	printf("Fibonacci(%d) = %d\n", n, Fn);
	return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Fibonacci(10) = 55
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here we define the return type as =int=, as we want our function to
return an integer. We define one input argument, called =n=, which is
also an =int= type. Then in the body of the function, we do our
calculations.

Unlike in some languages such as Python, Matlab, and R, in C,
functions can only return a single value. There is a way to achieve
the same result however, which is to return a *pointer* to a complex
data type such as an array, or a structure. We will talk about complex
data types in the next section.

** Recursion

Note in the Fibonacci example above, that in the body of our function,
if the value of the input argument =n= is not =0= or =1=, then the
function ends up calling itself (on line 6 of the code listing). When
a function calls itself, this is called *recursion*, or a *recursive
function call*. Recursion allows for very compact code, and for
intuitive definitions. You may see recursion used in mathematical
functions, and also in algorithms like sorting and searching. The cost
of recursion is that sometimes the overhead involved in the computer
repeatedly calling functions over and over again, can be costly, but
this really depends on the nature of the algorithm. For Fibonacci
numbers, recursion is OK for small =n= but once =n= becomes large, it
is really slow. As an exercise, you could try to re-code the Fibonacci
function using a loop instead of recursion. Another thing to try is
*memoization* (look it up, I didn't mis-spell it).

* Argument Checking

Note that if we pass an argument of the wrong type to a function, the
program may still compile, and even run, and it will simply spit out
crazy values. Sometimes we will get a compiler warning, but sometimes
not. Be very careful that the input values you pass to functions, and
the output values you receive from functions, are what is expected.

* Variable Scope

Any variables declared inside a function, are *local to that
function*, and are not accessible outside of the function. Similarly,
code within a function doesn't have access to variables that have been
declared outside of that function (for example in another function, or
in =main()=). If you want this functionality, then you can specify
that a variable be *global*. Any variable declared outside of *any*
function (it also has to be outside of =main()=) is global, and can be
seen by every function. In C, global variables are known as *external*
variables (they are external to any function).

For example in the following code, the variable =myGlob= is declared
outside of =main()= and outside of =myFunc()= and thus can be accessed
by code within both. The variable =myInt= is declared within the
function =myFunc()= and is thus *local* to =myFunc()= and cannot be
accessed outside of =myFunc()= (for example within
=main()=). Similarly, the variable =myChar= is declared within
=main()= and so cannot be seen within =myFunc()=.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <stdio.h>

float myGlob = 3.14;

void myFunc(void) {
	int myInt = 8;
	printf("my favourite number is %d\n", myInt);
	printf("my favourite float is %.2f\n", myGlob);
//	printf("my favourite letter is $c\n", myChar); // THIS WOULD NOT WORK
}

int main() {
	char myChar = 'x';
	printf("my favourite letter is %c\n", myChar);
	myFunc();
	printf("my favourite float is %.2f\n", myGlob);
//	printf("my favourite number is %d", myInt); // THIS WOULD NOT WORK
	return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
my favourite letter is x
my favourite number is 8
my favourite float is 3.14
my favourite float is 3.14
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Automatic vs Static Variables

We talked about variable *scope* and the idea that variables declared
within a function are *local* to that function. What actually happens
is that each time a function is called by another piece of code, all
the variables declared within the function are created (that is,
memory is allocated to hold them). When a function is finished, all of
that local memory storage is de-allocated, and those variables
essentially disappear. This is known as *automatic* local variables
(they are automatically created and then destroyed as the function is
called, and then finishes).

If you want local variables to persist, you can declare them as
*static* local variables. You simply insert the word =static= in front
of the variable type when you declare it inside your function. When
declared in this way, the variable will *not be destroyed* when the
function exits, but it (and its value) will persist. Next time the
function is called, the value will have retained the value from the
previous function call. It's a sort of global variable, but one that
is still only accessible within the function in which it's declared.

Here's an example program that maintains a running count of the number
of times the function =myFun()= has been called.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <stdio.h>

void myFunc(void) {
	static int num = 0;
	num++;
	printf("myFunc() has been called %d times so far\n", num);
}

int main() {
	myFunc();
	myFunc();
	myFunc();
//	printf("num = %d\n", num);  // THIS WOULD NOT WORK
	return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
myFunc() has been called 1 times so far
myFunc() has been called 2 times so far
myFunc() has been called 3 times so far
#+END_EXAMPLE

When would you want to use *static* variables? One general case, like
above, is when you want to keep track of the number of times a
function has been called. Another reason has to do with
efficiency... if for example your function declares a *large* local
variable whose values don't change from one function call to the next,
it may be more efficient to declare it as static, so that it is
created and initialized only once.

* Variadic Functions

A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function][variadic function]] is one which accepts a variable number of input
arguments. In C we can write functions that are variadic. Sometimes
this may be useful.

Here is a simple example of how one would do this, taken from
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Variadic-Example.html#Variadic-Example][here]]. See [[http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Variadic-Functions.html#Variadic-Functions][this]] page for more details.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int
add_em_up (int count,...)
{
  va_list ap;
  int i, sum;

  va_start (ap, count);         /* Initialize the argument list. */

  sum = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
    sum += va_arg (ap, int);    /* Get the next argument value. */
       
  va_end (ap);                  /* Clean up. */
  return sum;
}
       
int
main (void)
{
  /* This call prints 16. */
  printf ("%d\n", add_em_up (3, 5, 5, 6));
       
  /* This call prints 55. */
  printf ("%d\n", add_em_up (10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10));
       
  return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
16
55
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note we have to =#include <stdarg.h>= in order to use the handful of
functions necessary to work with the argument list.

Note we have already seen a sort of variadic function, which is the
=main()= function, which as we know can accept a variable number of
input arguments when the program is started at the command line.


* Exercises

- 1 Write a function that computes the nth [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number][Fibonacci number]]. Your
function should be called =fib= and should take as input a single
integer value =n=, and should return an integer value representing the
nth Fibonacci number.

The code example in the notes uses recursion to accomplish this. Write
your own function that doesn't use recursion, but uses a loop instead.

I should be able to paste your function at the bottom of this C
program [ [[file:code/exercises/5_1_go.c][code]] ] and it should run:

#+INCLUDE: "../code/exercises/5_1_go.c" src c

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ gcc -o go 5_1_go.c
$ ./go
fib(10)=55
#+END_EXAMPLE

- 2 Write a function that determines whether an integer is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number][prime]]. The
function should take as input a single integer, and return a 1 if the
input is prime, and a 0 if it is not.

I should be able to paste your function at the bottom of this C
program [ [[file:code/exercises/5_2_go.c][code]] ] and it should run:

#+INCLUDE: "../code/exercises/5_2_go.c" src c

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ gcc -o go 5_2_go.c
$ ./go
isprime(12)=0
isprime(17)=1
#+END_EXAMPLE

- 3 Write a program that prints out the first 1000 prime numbers. You
can find a list to verify the correctness of your program [[http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/1000.txt][here]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1: 2
2: 3
3: 5
4: 7
5: 11
... (deleted for brevity) ...
996: 7879
